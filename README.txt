I created this as a  helper for developers writing and recording
documentation and have the need to take screenshots like every
5 seconds !!
It has helped me alot in previous projects

All you do is run  the application  and dont forget 
to end it


When you run 'main.py'  a loop starts and screenshots 
will be capture every (a variable in main.py) seconds


I will add a  terminal for interactive use with options like 
    -number of images to capture
    -quality of images
    - folder to save
    - events for capturing screenshots
    - and many moree

 # Just run the 'main.py' in a terminal
